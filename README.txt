This is a Unity Game I am currently working on for fun.
I am using Unity Learn to learn C# scripting.
This project uses assets from UnityLearn Course: "Create with Code". Specifically Unit 4
I finished the tutorial and decided to have some fun with it, and continue developing more mechanics on my own.

This game is not intended for publishing and the assets are provided free to anyone interested in learning Unity.
